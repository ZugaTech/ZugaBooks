# 📊 ZugaBooks Financial Reporting Demo

ZugaBooks is a **production-ready demonstration** of a Streamlit-powered financial reporting application. It showcases a clean, intuitive user interface for fetching financial reports, visualizing data, and managing simulated connections to services like QuickBooks Online and Google Sheets.

> ⚠️ **Note:** QuickBooks now includes built-in reporting. This app is maintained as a demo version to showcase workflow and UI design from when it was actively in use.

This repository is intentionally built as a **portfolio piece** for potential employers, demonstrating best practices in UI/UX design, state management, and creating robust, user-friendly applications with Streamlit.
